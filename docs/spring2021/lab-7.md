*Lab by [Sergey Karayev](https://sergeykarayev.com) and [Saurabh Bipin Chandra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srbhchandra/).*

In this lab, we will do several things:

- Move from training on synthetic line data to training on real data -- the `IAMLines` data module
- Move from training on line data to training on paragraph data -- the `IAMParagraphs` data module
- Automatically save the final model
- Introduce `ParagraphTextRecognizer` class to load the model and run inference that we can use in production
