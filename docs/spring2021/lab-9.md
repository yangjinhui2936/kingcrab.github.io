*Lab by [Sergey Karayev](https://sergeykarayev.com).*

In this lab, we do several things.

- First, we speed up our ParagraphTextRecognizer model with TorchScript
- Next, we wrap the model in a web app, and send it some requests
- We package up the web app and model as a Docker container, and run it that way
- Lastly, we prepare to deploy as a serverless function using AWS Lambda, getting it working locally.
