# Full Stack Deep Learning - Course Spring 2021

!!! info
    This is the page for the 2021 edition of the course. For the 2022 edition, [click here](/course/2022).

We've updated and improved our materials for our 2021 course taught at UC Berkeley and online.

!!! info "Synchronous Online Course"
    We offered a [paid synchronous option](./synchronous) for those who wanted weekly assignments, capstone project, Slack discussion, and certificate of completion.

## Other Resources

[Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) is a great free two-course sequence aimed at first getting hackers to train state-of-the-art models as quickly as possible, and only afterward delving into how things work under the hood. Highly recommended for anyone.

[Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) is a great free textbook with Jupyter notebooks for every part of deep learning.

[NYUâ€™s Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) course has excellent PyTorch breakdowns of everything important going on in deep learning.

Stanfordâ€™s [ML Systems Design](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/syllabus.html) course has lectures that parallel those in this course.

[The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/) by Andrew Ng is a great weekly update on progress in the deep learning world.

[/r/MachineLearning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) is the best community for staying up to date with the latest developments.
