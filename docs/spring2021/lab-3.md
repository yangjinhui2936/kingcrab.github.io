*Lab by [Sergey Karayev](https://sergeykarayev.com).*

- 00:00 - Introduction.
- 01:59 - Introduce LineCNNSimple, a model that can read multiple characters in an image.
- 15:52 - Make this model more efficient with LineCNN, which uses a fully convolutional network.
- 18:18 - Upgrade the model further into LitModelCTC, which uses a CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss.
- 23:29 - Finalize your model, LineCNNLSTM, by adding an LSTM layer on top of CNN.
- 27:34 - Lab 3 homework.
