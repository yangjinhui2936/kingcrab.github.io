# How do I expense the bootcamp?

## Submitting a receipt

Upon registration, you'll receive an email from our event provider with your ticket
and your order details, including the last 4 digits of the credit card you used, if you used one.

This is often sufficient documentation.

## Verification of attendance

If you need your attendance verified,
please email us at `admin@fullstackdeeplearning.com`
after the event is finished and indicate the address to which we should send a verification email.

## Requesting approval

Some organizations require prior approval for education expenses from a manager.

In that case, you can work off of the email template below.
We suggest you customize it to your team and its needs.

Keep in mind that you want to make sure that it's clear to your manager
why sending you to this bootcamp is in the company's interest,
not just yours!

    Dear `{manager}`,

    I wanted to bring to your attention a bootcamp that I would love to enroll in. [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com) is hosting a two-day program that covers the emerging field of application development with Large Language Models (LLMs). FSDL is a respected name that has delivered educational material on productionizing machine learning in formats from large MOOCs to courses at top universities like UC Berkeley and UW.

    This bootcamp will provide me with the knowledge and skills necessary to build and deploy LLM applications and stay up-to-date with the state-of-the-art in the industry.

    Some of the benefits:

      - Coverage of both conceptual fundamentals and concrete engineering practices
      - Talks from leaders in the field, like Harrison Chase of [LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI)
      - Opportunities to network with builders

    I expect to be able to bring back my learnings and apply them directly to my work and share them with the team.

    The cost of the bootcamp is `{price}`. I strongly believe that this investment in my education will benefit the company in the long run.

    If you are interested, you can find more details about the bootcamp, including the instructors and their bios, at the following link: https://fsdl.me/2023-llmbc-landing.

    Thank you for considering my request.

    Best,

    `{name}`
